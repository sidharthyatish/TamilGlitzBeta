# TamilGlitzBeta
Official android app (unreleased) for entertainment based startup [TamilGlitz](https://tamilglitz.in/)

## Setting up
Cloning the repo must get it running, but the API end points are currently turned off. If the API is turned back on, app is good to go :)

## More about the app
Build using Java, Uses networking Library **Volley** for networking, image download as well as caching  
I have integrated **Youtube** player to play videos inside the app
I have removed it from playstore but could find it [here](https://apkpure.com/tamilglitz-beta/com.tamilglitz.sidharthyatish.tamilglitzbeta) :D
